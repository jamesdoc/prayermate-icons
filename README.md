# PrayerMate Icon Generator

## What is this?

PrayerMate has a default gallery of icons for different lists… but there are only 8 icons in the set which is a bit limiting. The idea of this project is to bring in a bigger icon set and allow users to create and download new icons.

## How do I use it?

1. Open [this on your phone](https://jamesdoc.github.io/prayermate-icons/)
2. Select an icon, set of colours, and then save the new icon
3. In PrayerMate go to edit a list…
   - Tap on the list icon
   - Change icon
   - Select photo from your device
   - Find the image that you downloaded.

## How do I make this better?

If you want to improve this you can submit a pull request. Or if you have an idea, please open an issue here… but as this was a quick project (see below) I'm not guaranteeing that it'll be implemented.
